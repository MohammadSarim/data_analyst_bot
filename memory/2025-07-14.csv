1,07:53:20,"""How many new members joined last month in airline?""","To determine the number of new members who joined the airline last month, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the ""join_date"" column to datetime format** to facilitate date-based operations.
2. **Extract the current month and year** to identify last month's date range.
3. **Calculate last month's year and month** to set the correct date range for filtering.
4. **Filter the dataframe** to include only those rows where the ""join_date"" falls within last month's date range.
5. **Count the unique ""customer_id"" entries** in the filtered dataframe to get the total number of new members.

Here's the Python code implementing these steps:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is the dataframe containing the customer data
df['join_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['join_date'])

# Determine current month and year
current_month = pd.to_datetime('today').month
current_year = pd.to_datetime('today').year

# Calculate last month's month and year
if current_month == 1:
    last_month = 12
    last_year = current_year - 1
else:
    last_month = current_month - 1
    last_year = current_year

# Define the date range for last month
start_date = pd.to_datetime(f""{last_year}-{last_month}-01"")
end_date = pd.to_datetime(f""{last_year}-{last_month}-31"")

# Filter the dataframe for last month's join dates
last_month_members = df[(df['join_date'] >= start_date) & (df['join_date'] <= end_date)]

# Count the number of unique customer_ids
new_members_last_month = last_month_members['customer_id'].nunique()

print(f""Number of new members who joined last month: {new_members_last_month}"")
```

This code efficiently filters the dataframe to count the number of new members who joined last month, ensuring accurate results by handling date transitions and potential edge cases."
