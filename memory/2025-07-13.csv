To cancel your ticket, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the Swiss Airlines website and click on the ""Manage your bookings"" tab.
2. Enter your booking reference number and last name to access your booking.
3. Select the flight you want to cancel and click on ""Cancel flight.""
4. Confirm your cancellation.

If you booked your ticket through a travel agent or third-party website, you will need to contact them directly to cancel your flight.

1,08:54:58,"In chinook DB, list the total sales per country. Which country's customers spent the most?","To list the total sales per country and determine which country's customers spent the most in the Chinook database, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.Country,
    SUM(i.Total) AS TotalSales
FROM 
    Customers c
JOIN 
    Invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY

This query will:

1. Join the `Customers` and `Invoices` tables based on the `CustomerId`.
2. Group the results by country.
3. Calculate the total sales for each country.
4. Sort the results in descending order by total sales.

The country at the top of the sorted list will be the one with the highest total sales.

To find out which country has the highest sales specifically, you can use:

```sql
SELECT TOP 1 
    c.Country,
    SUM(i.Total) AS HighestSales
FROM 
    Customers c
JOIN 
    Invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
